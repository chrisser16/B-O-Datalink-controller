# B-O-Datalink-controller
This is a project, that allows you to control a simple bluetooth module with the datalink protocol, with an arduino. ** Will be updated**

This code is made in C in the Atmel IDE environment and not in Arduino IDE, but Arduino IDE support the code anyways.

Pin configuration in code:

-Port = Arduino pin = purpose.

-PB0 = D8  = Play toggle pin.
-PB1 = D9  = Phono on/off.
-PB2 = D10 = Previous toggle pin.
-PB3 = D11 = Next toggle pin.
-PB4 = D12 = Stop toggle pin.

Schematic will come soon!
